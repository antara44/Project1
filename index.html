            <h3>Hello, it's Antara</h3>
                <h1>From Delhi Technological University</h1>
                <h3>And I am a <span class="text"></span></h3>
                <p> I believe everybody has a story, that deserves to be told.
                    All the stories about the silent battles that we fight and win, or fight and lose,
                    stories about the numerous times we broke our hearts,
                    stories about the countless failures, when we almost gave up, yet mustered enough courage to stand up again.
                    Stories about beauty and brutality, about ardent and passionate love, about how the sky turns into a kaleidoscope of million colours during sunset, about all the little things in life that makes us happy.

                <p>Come with me, and I will tell you a story.</p>

                <p >A small town in the heart of rural Bengal, is the place which is closest to my heart.....the fond memories of childhood, the bittersweet tears, the lazy evenings spent watching the sunset in the horizon, the holidays enjoyed near the little river flowing through the forest, the mornings welcomed watching the distant hills from the terrace....
                they say "home is where the heart is" and my heart will always be here.
